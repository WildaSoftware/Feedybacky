How to use Feedybacky's wrapper for Drupal:

1. Run "install.sh" shell script inside the "custom/feedybacky" module (at the level where "feedybacky.info.yml" file is located).
2. Copy whole "custom/feedybacky" directory (with subdirectory "feedybacky" inside) into "modules" directory of your Drupal instance. If directory "custom" is already present, just place outside "feedybacky" directory inside "custom".
3. Install the module in Drupal admin panel.
4. Move to "admin/structure/block" page and place a new Feedybacky block to one of the regions.
5. Change settings of the block. Please use old Javascript's notation (for example, avoid arrow functions' notation).
