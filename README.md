Feedybacky
==========

### What is Feedybacky? ###

Feedybacky is simple JS plugin for web pages which facilitates feedback system. It creates a sliding element on HTML page in which an user can provide a request (error, suggest, comment etc.) and send it in rapid and easy way. The special part of this process is the fact, that Feedybacky allows to attach a screenshot of the current page and additional information **automatically**. It includes i.a. current URL, user agent string and - of course - current datetime. In many situations, request's text provided by a user is not sufficient to reproduce e.g. an error - Feedybacky tries to solve that problem.

Feedybacky uses `html2canvas` library created by Niklas von Hertzen.

### Installation ###

If you just want to use Feedybacky, you can copy the ZIP archive from the repository and unzip to the destinated directory. It is important to have all subfolders (`css`, `js` etc.) next to each other in the same folder.

Of course, you can also install Feedybacky as NPM package:

	npm install --save feedybacky

If you want to modify or build Feedybacky by yourself, you should install NPM dependencies by running `npm install` command, install `gulp-cli` globally (`npm install -g gulp-cli`) and run `gulp` in Feedybacky directory (`npm install gulp`). Afterwards, you can copy following directories to the destinated folder: `css`, `dependencies`, `i18n`, `img`, `js`.

Lastly, you can also fetch Feedybacky via CDN - if you would like to use the plugin this way, please check example page `examples/09-cdn.html` to display an example.

### How to include Feedybacky in my web page? ###

#### Standard way ####

Firstly, you have to create a DOM element anywhere on your web page:
```html
<div id="feedybacky-container"></div>
```	
Secondly, Feedybacky script should be included and its object initialized:
```javascript
<script type="text/javascript" src="js/feedybacky.min.js"></script>
//...
var feedybacky = new Feedybacky('feedybacky-container', {
	onSubmitUrl: url
});
```

If you want to pair plugin with Feedybacky portal, you need to fetch your Feedybacky API key and create a project in the portal to retrieve its symbol. Then you can use it on your WWW site in order to send request to Feedybacky portal. You should also provide URLs to terms and conditions and privacy policy of site, on which you place the plugin. The "legal" checkboxes are not checked by default but if a user checks them, the information in local storage is saved so these checkboxes would be checked by default later.
```javascript
var feedybacky = new Feedybacky('feedybacky-container', {
	apiKey: 'your Feedybacky API key',
	projectSymbol: 'your Feedybacky project symbol',
	termsUrl: 'link to terms and conditions',
	privacyPolicyUrl: 'link t privacy policy'
});
```
#### Angular ####

1. Add a DOM element to your root `.html` template (outside `<app-root></app-root>`):
```html
<div id="feedybacky-container"></div>
```
2. Edit your `angular.json` file:
```json
//...
"build": {
	//...
	{
		"styles": [
			//...
			"node_modules/feedybacky/css/feedybacky.min.css"
		],
		"scripts": [
			//...
			"node_modules/feedybacky/dependencies/html2canvas/html2canvas.min.js"
		]
	}
}
```
3. In your `app.component.ts` add:
```typescript
import { Feedybacky } from 'feedybacky';

export class AppComponent {
	protected feedybacky = new Feedybacky('feedybacky-container', {
		onSubmitUrl: url
	});
	//...
}
```
#### Vue.js ####
1. Add a DOM element to `public/index.html`:
```html
<div id="feedybacky-container"></div>
```
2. Import Feedybacky into `App.vue`:
```ts
import { Feedybacky } from 'feedybacky'

const feedybacky = new Feedybacky('feedybacky-container', {
  onSubmitUrl: url
});
```
3. Import additional styles and dependencies in `main.js`:
```ts
import 'feedybacky/css/feedybacky.min.css';
import 'feedybacky/dependencies/html2canvas/html2canvas.min.js';
```

#### React ####
1. Add DOM element to `public/index.html`:
```html
<div id="feedybacky-container"></div>
```
2. Import and init Feedybacky and import dependencies into `App.js`
```ts
import { Feedybacky } from 'feedybacky';
import 'feedybacky/css/feedybacky.min.css';
import 'feedybacky/dependencies/html2canvas/html2canvas.min.js';

new Feedybacky('feedybacky-container', {
  onSubmitUrl: url
})
```

`screenshotField ` - optional parameter for defining behaviour of the plugin during processing a screenshot. The default value is `"visible"` and it means that the checkbox is visible and a user can select if they would like to send a screenshot or not. The other possible values are `"autoEnable"` (the checkbox is not visible and the screenshot is sent automatically) and `"autoDisable"` (the checkbox is not visible and the screenshot is ignored).

`metadataField` - optional parameter for defining behaviour of the plugin during processing metadata. The default value is `"visible"` and other possibilities are similar as for `screenshotField` above.

This callback is invoked before sending a request to endpoint defined by `onSubmitUrl` parameter. It can be used to make some preparations before sending (for example, show loader animation) or add some additional fields to payload, such as authentication key. The last one can be achieved by `add` function invoked inside `beforeSubmit`, e.g.:

```ts
beforeSubmit: (payload) => {
	alert('We are in beforeSubmit function and we add some fields to payload.');

	payload.add('param1', 'Value of additional parameter 1');
	payload.add('param2', 'Value of additional parameter 2');
}
```

`onSubmitUrlSuccess` - optional callback function invoked after successful request sending to endpoint defined by `onSubmitUrl` parameter. It has two parameters: `statusCode` and `response` (the latter is textual representation of response body).

`onSubmitUrlError` - optional callback function invoked after failed request sending to endpoint defined by `onSubmitUrl` parameter. It has two parameters: `statusCode` and `response` (the latter is textual representation of response body).

`prefix` - optional parameter with text added to each request. It can be useful to distinct request sent from one site but in various sets of configuration - it can be used as tag, label.

`alertAfterRequest` - optional parameter which indicates if the alter after sending a request should be visible. Value should be of boolean type - the default value is `true`.

`adBlockDetected` - optional parameter to pass information about AdBlock detection from an external script or tool. This paramter can be useful in situations where basic detector in Feedybacky is not sufficient.

`side` - optional parameter for determining side of the Feedybacky. Default value is `right` and means that the plugin is visible on the right side of the website. Another possible value is `left`.

`order` - optional parameter passing an order of the form elements. It should contain specific element identifiers divided by commas and can be also use to hide some parts. Default value is `"description,message,email,explanation,screenshot,metadata,history,termsAccepted,personalDataAccepted,note"`. 

`classes` - optional parameter which can be used to pass JSON object with keys as element identifiers and values with class names list for such element. Available keywords are `title, description, message, email, explanation, screenshot, metadata, history, termsAccepted, personalDataAccepted, note, send, powered`.

`expandMessageLink` - optional parameter to make expand link visible. If it is correct, the link is present under message input and causes expanding the message area and the whole form. The default value is `false`.

`theme` - optional parameter which stores a name of UI theme which will be used for the extended form. There are two predefined themes - default and dark. It is possible to set theme in runtime by using `setTheme` method, as well as adding own theme names (look at `allowedThemes` parameter). If given theme is not allowed, the `default` will be used. The default value is `default`.

`allowedThemes` - optional parameter with array of possible themes which can be set at init of the form as well as in runtime. The default value is `['default', 'dark']`.

### Methods ###

After creating the Feedybacky object, some methods could be invoked on it:

`open` - immediate opening the container with Feedybacky form.

`close` - immediate closing the container with Feedybacky form.

`setTheme(themeSymbol)` - change the current theme. For example, calling `setTheme('dark')` changes the theme to dark in runtime. If given theme is not allowed, the current theme stays.

### Wrappers ###

Feedybacky can be also useful in some systems which provide a module subsystem helping non-programmers to use various plugins. In `wrappers` directory there are wrappers with manuals for:

* Wordpress
* Drupal

They are very simple ports of the plugin to these systems (they can be developed if necessary) and can be used as well as standard form of Feedybacky.
